							<p>Welcome to the world of Java! 
							If you are new to Java, this is a great place to begin learning it.
							 Java is an object-oriented programming language, and is much larger and more complex than web languages like HTML or CSS.
							  If you are just starting as a programmer, I would highly recommend starting with one of these easier language before moving to Object Oriented Programming languages,
							   such as Java or Visual Basic.</p>
